# 12s Patience

This is a simple python program to play through the patience / solitaire card game where you have to match pairs of cards that add up to 12, or match 4 of a kind picture cards or royal flush / straights.

It simply plays through as many deals as you specify and sums all the wins, giving you the statistical probability of the game being won.
